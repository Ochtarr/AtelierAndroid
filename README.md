# Atelier Java Embarqué
# Project 2017

## Description
Develop an Android application that allows the downloading of a video file from the web and streaming among Android devices.
For the purpose of this project you will need at least two Android devices that will act as a server and client as described below.

## 1st Device (server)
Downloads a video file from a location on the internet.
Saves the video file locally.
Serves the downloaded video file to nearby devices.

## 2nd Device (client)
Discovers and connects to nearby devices that serve the video file.
Streams the video file from the connected peer (server).

## Guidelines
For the Peer-to-peer (P2P) device communication use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi P2P.
Develop only one application, the same for both devices. The devices should be able to determine if they should be server or client.
Handle activity state and configuration changes.
Allow the user to manage network usage through settings.
Since you’re going to work in teams, try to use collaborative tools e.g., GitHub, etc.

## Bonus
Try to find ways to improve and make your application optimal e.g., background jobs, performance, privacy and security, network data usage, etc.
